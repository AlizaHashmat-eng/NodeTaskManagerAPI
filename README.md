# Task Management API

## Introduction
The **Task Management API** is a powerful application built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, designed to help users efficiently manage and track their tasks. This API supports user authentication, task assignments, notifications, and a rich set of features aimed at improving productivity and collaboration.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration, login, and profile management. Users can create accounts and authenticate using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Task Management**: Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. Each task can have attributes such as:
  - **Title**: A short, descriptive title for the task.
  - **Description**: Detailed information about what the task entails.
  - **Due Date**: A deadline for task completion.
  - **Status**: Current state of the task (e.g., "in progress," "completed," "pending").
- **Task Assignments**: Assign tasks to other users to streamline collaboration. Track assigned tasks to see who is responsible for what.
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications about task assignments, updates, and reminders for approaching due dates, ensuring users never miss important deadlines.
- **Task Filtering and Sorting**: Easily retrieve and manage tasks based on parameters such as due date, status, priority, and assigned user, making task management more efficient.
